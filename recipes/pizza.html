        <h3>Steps to make Pizza</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Activate & mix dough (5 min): In a bowl, stir warm water + sugar + yeast. Wait 5 min until foamy. Add flour, salt, 1 tbsp oil. Mix, then knead 5–7 min until smooth (add a sprinkle of flour if sticky).</li>
            <li>Rise (45–60 min): Lightly oil the bowl, put dough in, cover, and let it double in size.</li>
            <li>Preheat & prep toppings (10 min): Heat oven to 475°F / 245°C. In a pan, cook chicken with a little olive oil + pinch of salt until done. Lightly soften onions & peppers (1–2 min) in the same pan.</li>
            <li>Shape the crust (2–3 min): Oil a baking sheet or pizza pan. Press/stretch dough into a thin round (12–14"). Poke a few holes with a fork to prevent bubbles.</li>
            <li>Assemble: Brush dough with olive oil (this is the “sauce”). Add mozzarella, then chicken, peppers, onions. Lightly salt if you like.</li>
